Pupil Travel Declaration

Dear Parents,

  

Travel declarations only need to be submitted for the June and Nov/Dec school holidays with the exception of parents of P1 children who must all declare travel plans. Pupils from P2 to P6 will only need to declare their travel plans if they intend to travel.
