**Mission**

  

We aim to instill in our pupils a love for participation in physical, sports and outdoor education&nbsp;

  

  

Physical Education plays a crucial role in the all-round development of pupils. Through a myriad of activities, pupils are provided with ample opportunities to engage themselves in authentic situations that will help them to acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values towards embracing a love for an active and healthy lifestyle.

  

As part of their character development, pupils learn to work cooperatively and collaboratively with one another in the various learning areas in the PE curriculum, as well as in the programmes tailored for each level.

  

To further develop pupilsâ€™ talents and interests, the school has a Co-Curricular Activities programme that encourages all pupils to engage in learning that differs from the confines of a classroom.

  

  

All pupils from Primary 1 to 2 attend 2 hours of PE a week, while pupils from Primary 3 to 6 attend 2.5 hours of PE&nbsp; a week.  

  

Throughout their primary school years, a progressive approach is adopted to guide the pupils through six Learning Areas (Sports &amp; Games, Gymnastics, Athletics, Outdoor Education, Dance and Physical &amp; Health Fitness). Through these Learning Areas, pupils develop a sense of self, through the acquisition of Fundamental Movement Skills (FMS), an understanding of games concepts, rhythm and movement, and an appreciation of the outdoors.

  

Primary 3 pupils also attend Swimsafer 2.0 to attain the Swimming learning outcomes in the PE curriculum.
