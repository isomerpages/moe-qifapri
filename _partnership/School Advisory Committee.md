School Advisory Committee
=========================

Qifa Primary School has 114 proud years of school history. Qifa Primary School, previously called Khee Fatt Study Institution, was established by the Char Yong (Dabu) Association, a clan association formed by Hakka immigrants in the early 1900s.  Although the Char Yong (Dabu) Association handed over the administration of the school to the Ministry of Education in 1985, the association continues to play a key role in supporting education in Qifa through their active involvement in Qifa’s School Advisory Committee (SAC). Qifa Primary School has actively engaged and grown from the synergistic partnership with our SAC members from the Char Yong (Dabu) Association. Their continual and firm support has been critical in establishing our strong school culture and tradition, and in bringing the school to where it is today.
