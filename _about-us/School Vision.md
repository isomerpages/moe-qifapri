The emblem of the tree which forms the central motif of the school crest represents enduring strength and growth. The tree provides shelter and sustenance, signifying the school’s desire to provide a safe environment where all can thrive as we seek to realise the school vision: ‘An Achieving School with a Caring Environment’. The roots which spread out symbolises stability and the laying of a strong foundation to equip the pupils with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to blossom and bear fruit as the school name 启 发 suggests.
