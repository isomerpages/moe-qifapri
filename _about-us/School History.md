School History
==============

  
Qifa Primary School, previously known as Khee Fatt Study Institution 启发学堂 was set up in 1906 by the Char Yong (Dabu) Association. After the Second World War, Khee Fatt School was officially opened by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore, on 13 October 1966. Over time, English medium schools became more popular therefore the Association handed the school over to the Ministry of Education in 1984. As a government school, Qifa continues to enjoy a good and unique relationship with its founding organisation.
