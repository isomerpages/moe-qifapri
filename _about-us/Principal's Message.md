It is my pleasure to welcome you and your children back to a new school year and to QIFA, a wonderful school founded 113 years ago, which has since grown into a school of choice among parents, educators and students.

  

Qifa, **'启发'** which denotes enlightenment, calls out to all educators to inspire our young charges, by arousing in them, the deep desire to discover learning for themselves. The school has in place, myriad programmes that aim to bring this about. The Applied Learning Programme – Effective Communication grooms our pupils to be engaged thinkers, confident communicators and self-directed learners. Our Learning for Life Programme, CHAMPS@Qifa, blends sports and values-driven education, to equip pupils with life-skills and values such as teamwork, perseverance, sportsmanship, self-discipline and care for one another. We also have a range of academic programmes that nurture every child to reach their potential. We offer the literature appreciation programme, E2K (a gifted education module) for Mathematics and Science, and the Mathematics Olympiad for students who have a strong foundation in these subjects. We also provide specialized programmes such as the reading and dyslexia remediation, learning support for English and Mathematics and various other targeted intervention programmes for students who need the support.

  

Dedicated and competent, our teachers ensure that learning is meaningful through the use of visible thinking strategies and formative assessment. Teachers build a strong relationship with students through the STAR (Student-Teacher Awesome Relationship) periods while students are encouraged to care for one another through training in peer-support and mediation strategies.

  

**启发** also describes our students who have gone on to become men and women of good character, captains of industry and leaders in varied fields of work. They are the inspiration for the young in the school today. Imbued with a growth mindset and exposed to the 21st century competencies, our students strive hard and do well in all domains – academically as well as in arts and sports. All these are possible because of the dedication and care in nurturing them to be the best they can be.

_Qifa – a place where we…_

_Plant the seed of wonder_

_Grow the tree of knowledge and_

_Harvest the fruits with love._
	
I invite all of you to join me, in working together to bring out the best in your children by providing them with a rich, stimulating learning environment, one where they will discover their gifts and passions.
