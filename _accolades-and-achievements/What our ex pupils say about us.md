My 6-year journey with Qifa Primary School has been a wonderful one. It is a tale full of enriching and exciting experiences. It has, in a way, helped shape my path into NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, where I am a student today.

Now, why would I make such a comment? Well, it is probably through a smorgasbord of activities and events the school organised that helped me recognise and develop my talent and passion for all things Math and Science. To list a few of them of the top of my head, there were Math Olympiad trainings, New South Wales, Math Olympiad competitions, as well as Science competitions.

Away from the topic of academics and on to the topic of environment.&nbsp; What do I think of the school atmosphere? Well, for a start the environment was very conducive and congenial. The teachers were friendly and did their best to help everyone excel. This is certainly a great atmosphere for studying, improving and having fun.

This six-year journey is certainly one that I would remember. Even as I head into my future endeavours, I will always keep close to heart the wonderful memories and long lasting friendships that are all certainly a result of my six years at Qifa Primary School.
