Parent Support Group
====================
![2023 - 2025 PSG EXCO](/images/WhatsApp_Image_2023_11_09_at_09_36_00__1_.jpeg)

At Qifa Primary School, the parents play an active role as partners to work alongside the teachers and support the school’s activities.    
  
Qifa Parent Support Group (PSG) is a voluntary organization. Its members comprise mainly of parents and even grandparents of students currently enrolled in the school.  
  
We believe that parents play an important role in our children’s growing-up years. They are co-educators in our children’s quest for knowledge, values and challenges.    
  
With this in mind, a hand outstretched to either pupils or staff in an hour of need would make a world of difference!   
  
If you are willing to give some of your time this year and make a difference in your child’s school life, all it takes is to complete this [application form](https://go.gov.sg/qps-psg).   
  
We look forward to a fruitful and close partnership with you. Together we can make Qifa Primary an enriching place for our children.
