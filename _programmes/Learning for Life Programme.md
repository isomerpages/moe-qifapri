## Learning for Life Programme

<img style="width:85%" src="/images/learningprog.jpg">

#### Overview

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) aims to provide students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and strengthen their people skills.

Learning for Life is integral to&nbsp;Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), which encourages in students a sense of rootedness and responsibility for their community and fellow Singaporeans. Activities might include outdoor adventure learning, sports, student leadership development, uniformed groups, performing and visual arts.

**Character Moulding Programme through Sports (CHAMPS) @ Qifa**&nbsp;aims to provide Qifa students with multiple platforms to experience and enact life-skills and values such as teamwork, perseverance, sportsmanship, self-discipline and care for one another. The following guiding principles are considered in identifying and developing the programme:

*   Sports might not build character, but character can be taught and learnt in a sports setting only if the environment is structured and a stated and planned goal is to develop character over time
*   Sports setting can include learning about sports, participation in competition and spectatorship
*   Character building through sports needs to include role models such as coaches, teachers, peers and parents
*   CHAMPS @ Qifa augments the CCE and Student Leadership efforts in the school

<u>Approach</u>

With a tiered approach, students can look forward to customised experiences such as assembly talks, intra- and inter-class activities and leadership trainings. A three-tiered approach is adopted to provide breadth and depth to the majority and selected student population respectively.
