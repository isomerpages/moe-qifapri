## Applied Learning Programme

#### Acquiring Skills through Applied Learning Programme

Our school offers Effective Communication as our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) designed to develop our pupils to be effective communicators and active thinkers.

**Qifa News Network (QNN)**

Qifa News Network (QNN), the school’s newscast and signature programme, provides the platform to develop pupils who display an interest in broadcast journalism. Pupils are trained to be little journalists and news presenters. They are given the opportunities to participate in the production and presentation of QNN which serve as the window into the school’s events and immersion trips.
