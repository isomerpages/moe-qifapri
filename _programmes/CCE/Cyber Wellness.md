Cyber Wellness
==============

The key approach to Cyber Wellness (CW) in Qifa is steered by the mission to equip pupils with life-long social and emotional competencies and sound values so that they can become safe, respectful and responsible users of Information Communications Technology (ICT). According to MOE CW framework, the three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to, will help our pupils to make careful and well-considered decisions when they are in cyberspace.

**1st principle**:

*   Respect for Self and Others reminds students to uphold their own dignity when online (e.g. share appropriate content, participate in only legal online activities). It guides students to respect others (e.g., put themselves in others’ shoes; accept diverse views and opinions, give credit when using other people’s work and seek permission where necessary, and to avoid sharing hurtful materials.)

**2nd principle**:

*   Safe and Responsible Use teaches students about the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviour, inappropriate online content, and to take steps to protect themselves (e.g., to keep their personal information private, verify the reliability of information sources). This principle also guides students to maintain a healthy balance of online and offline activities.

**3rd principle**:

*   Positive Peer Influence which encourages students to be a positive role model online and to advocate positive online behaviour. This includes sharing healthy and positive content, using technology for good, and standing up for victims of cyber bullying.

Qifa has implemented a holistic approach to CW education guided by the framework. This comprises CW lessons during Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), assembly talks, and CW school-wide programmes that aim to develop and empower our pupils into responsible digital learners.

CW lessons during FTGP periods aim to equip students with life-long social-emotional competencies and sound values, so that they can become safe, respectful, and responsible users of ICT.

  

**Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) lessons on CW**

The FTGP lessons on CW were carried out in Semester 1. These lessons seek&nbsp;to equip students with life-long social-emotional competencies and sound values so that they can become safe, respectful and responsible user of Information Communications Technology (ICT). The CW lessons conducted are as follows:

Beyond CW lessons in FTGP and CCE, subject teachers infuse new media literacies as well as CW skills (e.g., not sharing of passwords, logging out of shared computers) into ICT-enabled lessons. Our school has initiated programmes such as Assembly talks and Cyber Wellness Day, to supplement the lessons as well.

**Assembly Talks**

The Republic has introduced digital defence as the sixth pillar in its national defence framework Total Defence, signalling the threat cyber-attacks and disinformation pose, and the importance of cyber security.&nbsp;Digital Defence – Be Secure, Alert, and Responsible Online– is a whole-of-nation effort to protect and defend ourselves and our nation online. Qifa Primary School has carried out Pre Assembly Talk on Digital Defence to allow pupils to understand how to discern hallmarks of fake or sensationalised reports by checking against credible sources of information such as those of government agencies and official sources.

**CW Workshops**

Our CW efforts also aim to develop student leaders to be advocates of CW in our school. The CW workshops for our Student Cyber Wellness Ambassadors (CWSAs) were carried out to engage pupils in positive peer influence to spread CW messages amongst their peers. These training workshops aim to develop ambassadors who can support their peers in cyber issues and champion CW-related efforts.

One of our&nbsp;Qifa Primary School Cyber Wellness Ambassador, Ethan Tan Jiale, of Primary 6 Exemplary, was presented with the Cyber Wellness Student Ambassador (CWSA) Award 2019. The CWSA Award recognises student ambassadors who demonstrate leadership and commitment to the school’s Cyber Wellness efforts, and for their active involvement and notable contribution in promoting Cyber Wellness education amongst their peers.

**CW Activities**

This year, some of our cyber wellness ambassadors took part in the inaugural National CW Advocacy Challenge (NCAC) organised by Crescent Girls’ School (CGS). The theme for this year challenge is “Academic Productivity &amp; Well-Being with Mobile Devices &amp; Screen Time” The ambassadors will be designing a comprehensive CW toolkit for their peers so that they can manage their screen time better.

The CWSA workshops equipped the ambassadors with facilitation skills and questioning techniques that enable them to design interesting cyber wellness activities for their peers during the cyber wellness day. The theme for term 2 cyber wellness day was “Digital Defence”.

Together with our CWSAs,&nbsp;the school&nbsp;ensures our students are safe and have positive experiences online by adopting positive CW habits.
