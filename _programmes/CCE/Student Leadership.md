### Student Leadership Development Program

  

The whole school approach to Student Leadership Development in Qifa Primary School is steered by the school’s mission to develop leaders of character and socially responsible global citizens. The school believes that every child is a leader and that leadership is influence. The school provides leadership training and opportunities for all pupils, which include formal leadership appointments or opportunities within their project groups.

### Prefects’ Investiture

  

The Prefects’ Investiture is a ceremony to install our prefects into their roles for the year. On this significant day, the school came together to witness and applaud the official appointment of the prefects.

### Primary 6 Head Prefect Election

  

The school has introduced a new experience to all pupils this year. For the first time, the school held an election for the position of Head Prefect. Five shortlisted candidates delivered their campaign speeches before the whole school and rallied for support from their peers during recesses in the week leading up to the election. Through this experience, we aim to give the students the authentic experience of exercising their right to vote and also instill in them a sense of ownership by giving them a voice in choosing their student leader.

### “Lead to Serve, Serve to Lead”

  

To nurture the students’ potential to be socially responsible, the school has organised various activities that are values-driven and student-centric. For example, student leaders will run fundraising activities yearly for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to raise awareness and advocate the need to prevent cruelty to animals and the importance of wildlife conservation. Student leaders also embark on Friend of Singa project as they spread kindness in the school and demonstrate the school value ‘A Caring Heart’ to their peers through assembly talks and various hands-on and classroom activities. At the end of the year, student leaders will engage in meaningful conversations with their teachers during Focus Group Discussions and raise underlying school issues that need to be improved and the student leaders will come together to brainstorm for solutions to address these issues through School Improvement Project. These activities help nurture the student leaders into self-discipline leaders who role model and demonstrate exemplary character and school values through their behaviour and actions.
