**_The 4 core NE Events_**

  

**Total Defence Day**

  

Schools commemorate Total Defence Day on 15 February annually to mark Singapore's fall to the Japanese in 1942. Total Defence Day serves to remind our pupils that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending, and we ourselves must defend Singapore.

***NE message: We must ourselves defend Singapore.***
	
**International Friendship Day**

  

International Friendship Day is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and beyond.

It serves as a good opportunity to help pupils learn and appreciate other cultures as well as nurture in them the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different people.

**Racial Harmony Day**

Racial Harmony Day serves to remind our pupils that race and religion are potential fault-lines in Singapore society. It is a day for schools to reflect on, and celebrate our success as a harmonious nation and society built on a rich diversity of cultures and heritages.

#### **_Social Studies_**

  

The primary focus of SS would be to develop pupils into informed, concerned and participative citizens at the local and global level. It seeks to evoke pupils’ curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives.

  

As part of engaging pupils’ interest in inquiry based learning, learning journeys are weaved into the SS curriculum. Learning journeys allows pupils to seek joy in learning and contextualise their learning experiences in an authentic real-world setting. It aims to excite and sustain pupils’ interest in the subject as they learn to explore, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topics being studied.
