The **_Model Class Award_** has been designed based on a holistic approach of encompassing the school values of **ASPIRE (_A_** _Caring Heart, **S**elf-Discipline and Integrity, **P**ride in Work, **R**esilience and **E**nterprising Spirit)_. This award has incorporated the integral programmes initiated by Qifa to augment the character development of our pupils.

The programmes for assessment are:

1.      Demonstrate Best Behaviour during lessons (_Self-Discipline and Integrity_)

2.      Clean and Green Classroom (_A Caring Heart, Self-Discipline & Integrity, Pride in Work_)

3.      Fruity Veggie Challenge (_Self-Discipline & Integrity, Inquiring Mind & Healthy Body_)

4.      Attire Check (_Self-Discipline_)

Pupils are assessed as a cohesive unit in their respective classes within a supportive environment that allows them to work collaboratively to achieve a communal goal. This fosters a strong sense of belonging towards our school community.

The school celebrates the achievements of these classes by awarding them with the **Model Class Award** certificates during a presentation ceremony conducted during the respective level’s Year Head morning assembly programme each Semester whereby two Model Classes for each term will be recognised for their efforts. These certificates will be prominently displayed in class to further affirm their accomplishments.

The **_Model Class Award_** inspires and nurtures our pupils to grow into independent learners who demonstrate integrity and responsibility, and ultimately becoming self-disciplined individuals.

The Qifa Star Pupil Award is presented to deserving pupils who have demonstrated exemplary character and commendable personal qualities based on the school values of **ASPIRE (_A_** _Caring Heart, **S**elf-Discipline and Integrity, **P**ride in Work, **R**esilience and **E**nterprising Spirit)_. 

Every semester, two pupils from each respective class will be nominated by their Form Teachers, in consultation with Co-Form teachers, respective Mother Tongue Language teachers and other Subject teachers, for this award.  Pupils are strongly encouraged to demonstrate at least two school values consistently and possess a minimum of a “_Good”_ Conduct Grade.

The school celebrates the achievements of these pupils by awarding them with **Star Pupil Award** certificates during a presentation ceremony during the respective level’s Year Head morning assembly programme during each Semester. The certificates will be accompanied by written testimonials from teachers affirming the positive qualities displayed by these pupils. Photographs of these awardees will be prominently displayed on the **Star Pupil** notice board to further affirm their accomplishments.

A **Special Award** will also be conferred at the end of the year for one pupil from each respective class who achieved significant improvements in their behaviour through their resolve and strength of character.

These awards serve as the best inspiration for pupils to emulate desirable character traits.

**Aim**

COOL (Caught dOing gOod in schooL) Kids is an initiative to publicly recognise and affirm pupils who have displayed behaviour exemplifying our school values –ASPIRE, and the Cool Kids serve as role models to the rest of the pupils in the school.

**Guiding Principle – Values are taught and caught**

Values are taught when they are explicitly expressed through the knowledge and skills encapsulated in the CCE curriculum. Values are caught when students see values lived out in different learning experiences. Positive reinforcement of good behaviours and/or deeds is essential to the character development of the students.

**Approach**

Deserving pupils are identified and nominated by their teachers.  To promote student voice in the nomination process, each class also has a Cool Kids Corner. The school affirms these pupils' good deeds through a presentation ceremony during the morning assembly programme at the end of each Semester. Photographs of COOL Kids and a write-up of their good deeds are displayed on the school website.
