To Earth With Love Project 2020
===============================
The world celebrates **Earth Day** annually. 22 April 2020 marks 50 years of **Earth Day**. To celebrate **Earth Day**, the school prepared an online learning package. **"To Earth with Love"** for our students. Qifa students learnt how to make no-sew face masks. They also participated 3Rs **(Reduce, Reuse, Recycle)** at home.
