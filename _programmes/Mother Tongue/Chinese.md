**Mother Tongue Department**
----------------------------

  

**Mission:**<br>
To develop life-long learners with a passion for their Mother Tongue languages.

  

**Approach:**  <br>
The MT believes in getting ‘REAL’:&nbsp;**R**eal&nbsp;**E**xperiences &amp;&nbsp;**A**uthentic&nbsp;**L**earning. We seek to provide a REAL environment for our pupils through programmes that focus on Effective Communication, and Pedagogy and Curriculum that Centered by Differentiation Instructions within the classrooms.

  

To provide an authentic setting for pupils to communicate beyond the classroom, we collaborate with our parent volunteers to adapt the concept of Kidzania to Qifa called Kidzania@Qifa. We create a mini-community with parents role-playing doctors, zoo keepers, taxi drivers and policewomen etc.&nbsp; The objective of this programme to create authentic settings for the pupils to use their mother tongue languages to converse and interact with others.

To develop our pupils into confident speakers, we encourage the pupils to share their favourite stories with their peers during recess time through the Bookalicious programme. To engage their peers, they are encouraged to present their stories in the form of a skit or any other creative form.&nbsp;

To provide the targeted help that some of our pupils need, we train Parent Volunteers and Pupils to become Oral Conversation Coaches and Buddies.

We take into considerations learners’ readiness in our lessons. Our resources are customised to meet the needs of different learners, according to their level of readiness. For example, comprehension questions for P3 and P4 are categorized according to different skills required, and progressive intervention at various stages are deployed to help pupils of all ability to progress.
