### Our Key Programmes

  

The Tamil Department embarks on programmes to excite and engage pupils to develop joy in learning the language. Pupils are provided with differentiated learning experiences and a variety of teaching resources (e.g. newspapers, video clips and other ICT-enabled tools) are used to enhance the teaching and learning of Tamil Language.

  

### Reading Programme

  

Supplementary reading programme and Buddy Reading are conducted to develop pupils into avid readers. Activities such as Book Talk, Show and Tell and Book-a-licious are carried out to engage pupils in the reading programme. Pupils are also introduced to many different genres and exposed to a wide range of vocabulary words.

  

### Effective Communication

  

Pupils take part in activities that develop their oral skills through show and tell, role play, debate and speakerâ€™s corner and share a book approach. These activities are conducted during curriculum time and integrated into their unit work. Enrichment programmes such as Drama workshops are also conducted for pupils so as to enable them to speak confidently.

  

### Mother Tongue Fortnight

  

Pupils are exposed to Tamil language and culture through various cultural based activities. They are also given opportunities to showcase their talents. Activities such as Kidzania, Language and Cultural camp and School based competitions such as character portrayal, tongue twister and poetry writing are conducted in Term 3.
