**Music Education:**

  

Our music education believes that all children are capable of music making and have the innate ability to listen, sing, dance, play and express themselves musically. We aim to build a strong foundation in musicianship and allowing pupils to have a meaningful and authentic musical experience.

  

In line with the aims of the Music Syllabus, our curriculum is designed around six objectives which describe the music skills and knowledge pupils should acquire, as follows:

  

*   Sing and play melodic and rhythmic instruments individually and in groups
*   Create and improvise music
*   Describe and evaluate music through listening
*   Develop understanding of music elements/concepts
*   Discern and understand music from various cultures and of various genres
*   Understand the role of music in daily living

  

Pupils develop music appreciation and understanding through direct experiences in listening, creating and performing music. By understanding music in its sociocultural context, pupils better appreciate the role of music in their lives and develop meaningful involvement in music.

  

The diagram below summarises the main objectives of the music curriculum.
