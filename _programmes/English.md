<u>English Language Programs</u>

**_Writing Programme_**

<u>MLEA (Modified Language Experience Approach towards Writing) at Lower Primary Levels</u> 

In MLEA, there is a shared experience that is linked to the Big Book that has been read during Shared Reading. The shared experience provides the context and content for the pupils to think and talk about, using the language structures and vocabulary they have learnt in Shared Book Approach (SBA).

<u>Writing Process Cycle (WPC) at Upper Primary Levels</u>

Basing on the principles of the Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA) at the Lower Primary, WPC continues to guide pupils at the Upper Primary levels in the processes of planning, writing and reviewing before they apply these skills in writing independently.

**_Speaking and Representing_**

  

At each stage of language development, the ability to communicate effectively is very important. The acquisition and development of oral communication skills are necessary for building a strong foundation in English Language learning.  

  

Having the requisite speaking skills will enable pupils to convey and express their thoughts and opinions accurately, fluently and appropriately.
