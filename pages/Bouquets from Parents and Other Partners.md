“I am writing on behalf of my family, and would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the teachers of Primary 3\_\_ class for their continual help and support in my daughter’s education… My daughter felt frustrated in her first few months studying in Singapore because she could not understand the course materials and was unable to complete her assignments due to her EL limitation… at the end of Term 2, her EL examination results was ranked no. 2 in the class and no. 1 for Mathematics, Science and Chinese Language… we appreciate Qifa Primary School because the school provided her the opportunity… all her accomplishments are the result of her teachers' hard work.”

“From Primary One to now, the Form Teacher has given our child a lot of help not only in studies but also in moral education. She put in a lot of effort to encourage my child and&nbsp; I can see the changes my child has made…&nbsp; &nbsp;Other parents also have the same feedback as me.&nbsp; All my family members appreciate the Form Teacher’s efforts.”

“Thank you for all the support and guidance given to our child.&nbsp; Without it, he would not have had the opportunity to learn and improve himself in Qifa over the past 3 terms.&nbsp; We are glad that our child is in Qifa. The school and the staff has indeed lived up to its vision of ‘An Achieving School With A Caring Environment’.”

“I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to some of the pupils of 4E who have gone out of their way to help us… I would also like to thank the IT staff who came to assist us on system problem and network connection.&nbsp; We also appreciate the school teachers who bought us some drinks as we could not afford to break for lunch due to time constraints. We were touched by the school hospitality.”
