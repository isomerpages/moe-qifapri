“I am writing on behalf of my family, and would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the teachers of Primary 3\_\_ class for their continual help and support in my daughter’s education… My daughter felt frustrated in her first few months studying in Singapore because she could not understand the course materials and was unable to complete her assignments due to her EL limitation… at the end of Term 2, her EL examination results was ranked no. 2 in the class and no. 1 for Mathematics, Science and Chinese Language… we appreciate Qifa Primary School because the school provided her the opportunity… all her accomplishments are the result of her teachers' hard work.”

“From Primary One to now, the Form Teacher has given our child a lot of help not only in studies but also in moral education. She put in a lot of effort to encourage my child and&nbsp; I can see the changes my child has made…&nbsp; &nbsp;Other parents also have the same feedback as me.&nbsp; All my family members appreciate the Form Teacher’s efforts.”

“It is really heart-warming to know the Teachers and Principal in Qifa care so much for their pupils.&nbsp; Our child enjoys school very much as he is the only child at home and look forward to meeting his friends and teachers in school.”
